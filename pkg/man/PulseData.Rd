\title{Create an object for pulse-change count data}
\usage{
PulseData(counts, conditions, formulas, formulaIndexes = NULL,
  spikeins = NULL, groups = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{counts}{a matrix; column names correspond to sample names}

\item{conditions}{a data.frame;
the first column corresponds to the conditions given in \code{formulas}.}

\item{formulas}{a list, created by \code{\link{MeanFormulas}}}

\item{formulaIndexes}{a list of lists; defines indexes of formulas
used for calculation of the expected read number}

\item{spikeins}{NULL (default) or a list of two items:
\itemize{
\item refGroups, a character, which defines the group which should be
treated as a reference for normalisation
\item spikeLists, a list of character vectors with the spike-ins names and
the same structure as \code{formulaIndexes}.
}}

\item{groups}{NULL (default) or a formula or a vector,
e.g. ~ condition + time (if spike-ins are not provided).
The vector length must be the same as the sample number.
the names used in the \code{fractions} defines different fractions,
which should have distinct coefficients for mean expression fitting.}
}
\value{
an object of class "PulseData"
}

# for every item in formulaIndexes we have a set of spike-ins:

  pull_down      = list(labelled, unlabelled))
